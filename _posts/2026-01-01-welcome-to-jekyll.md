Welcome to your new Jekyll blog! This site is built with a beautiful Tufte-inspired design that emphasizes readability and elegant typography.

## Features

This blog includes several advanced features:

1. **Tufte-style typography** with wide margins and sidenote capabilities
2. **Two content types**: Essays for longer pieces, and Anecdotes for shorter observations
3. **Tag-based navigation** with a dynamic tag cloud
4. **Backlinks** that show which posts reference each other
5. **Recent and Updated sections** on the homepage

## Writing Tips

You can write your posts in Markdown. Posts go in the `_posts` folder, while anecdotes go in `_notes`.

Each post should have front matter that includes:

- `title`: The post title
- `date`: Publication date
- `tags`: Array of tags
- `excerpt`: Optional short description
- `updated`: Optional date for when you last updated the post

## Cross-linking

You can link to other posts like [this anecdote about Tufte](/anecdotes/tufte-css-inspiration), and backlinks will automatically appear at the bottom of linked posts.
