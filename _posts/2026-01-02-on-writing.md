excerpt: "Writing is not just about communicating ideas—it's a tool for thinking itself."

Writing is often seen as the final step in the creative process: you have an idea, you think it through, and then you write it down. But this misses the most important aspect of writing.

## Writing as Thinking

Writing *is* thinking. The act of putting words on a page forces you to clarify vague intuitions and half-formed thoughts. You discover what you think by writing.

As Joan Didion famously said:

> I don't know what I think until I write it down.

This is why keeping a blog or journal can be so valuable—not just as a record of your thoughts, but as a way of developing them in the first place.

## The Digital Garden

This connects to the concept of a "digital garden"—a collection of evolving notes and essays that grow and interconnect over time. Unlike a traditional blog with polished, finished posts, a digital garden embraces work-in-progress.

## Practical Advice

1. Write regularly, even if it's just for yourself
2. Don't worry about perfection on the first draft
3. Link your ideas together—backlinks help you see connections
4. Update old posts as your thinking evolves (that's what the `updated` field is for!)

The goal isn't to produce perfect prose every time, but to develop a practice of thinking through writing.
