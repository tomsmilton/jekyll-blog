If you're working on a problem in science, engineering, or medicine then NASA has already thought about it. NASA's work touches every part of STEM and fortunately for you they write about most of it on their technical report server ([NTRS](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/)). No one should start a project without first checking there! And as a second shot - the Defense Technical Information Center ([DTIC](https://discover.dtic.mil/)).
