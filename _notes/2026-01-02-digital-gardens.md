excerpt: "A digital garden is a collection of interconnected notes that grow and evolve over time."

A **digital garden** is a different way of thinking about online content. Instead of a blog with chronological posts, it's more like a wiki—a collection of notes that are continuously tended and updated.

## Key Principles

1. **Imperfection is okay**: Not everything needs to be polished
2. **Notes grow over time**: You add to and revise them continuously
3. **Connections matter**: Links between notes reveal interesting patterns
4. **Contextual browsing**: Readers explore via links, not chronology

## Examples

Some great digital gardens:

- [Maggie Appleton's Digital Garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden)
- [Andy Matuschak's Notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/)
- [Gwern.net](https://gwern.net/)

This site aims to support both polished essays and garden-like anecdotes that can evolve.

## Implementation

The backlinks feature on this site helps create that web of connections. When you link between posts, readers can see both forward and backward connections. Combined with tags, this creates multiple ways to explore content.
