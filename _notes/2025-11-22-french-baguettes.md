Everyone (?) loves French bread, and somehow it's impossible to find in the UK. Somewhere between Calais and Dover, bakers lose the ability to create the perfect baguette. Fortunately, at 7:12 AM every morning (and every half hour after that), a train screams from Paris to London. Fill the luggage racks with baguettes, open a stall at the King's Cross Market, and you'd make a killing from the only "real" French baguette in London.
