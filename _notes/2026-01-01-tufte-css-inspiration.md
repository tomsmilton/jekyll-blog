excerpt: "Edward Tufte's approach to information design inspired this site's visual style."

This site's design is heavily inspired by [Edward Tufte](https://www.edwardtufte.com/)'s work on information design and typography.

Tufte's books are famous for their distinctive layout:

- Wide margins for sidenotes and figures
- Serif fonts (ET Book, modeled after Bembo)
- Ample whitespace
- Integration of text and graphics

The [Tufte CSS project](https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/) by Dave Liepmann translates these principles to the web. This site builds on that foundation.

## Why Tufte?

Tufte's approach prioritizes **readability** and **information density** without clutter. The wide margins aren't just aesthetic—they provide space for supplementary information without breaking the reading flow.
