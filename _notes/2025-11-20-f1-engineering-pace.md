I am not a car guy. I have little interest in F1 - except for when I hear stories of unbelievable design iteration speed. At this year's ARIA Summit, Caroline Hargrove told of one of McLaren's cars performing poorly in the Thursday practice in Monaco. By Friday, they designed and manufactured a new wing, to be installed in Monaco on Saturday. Caroline carried the wing on her BA flight, putting it in the seat next to her - not exactly inconspicuous!

F1 is an example of the UK excelling in engineering, they have brilliant specialist supply chains, engineering teams who can move at pace, and the budget to match it! What can we do to bring this excellence and speed to other areas? What would it look like to have a scientific team performing at the standard an F1 team is?

Very few of these F1 stories are available online - if you've got these stories, then I'd love to speak with you.
