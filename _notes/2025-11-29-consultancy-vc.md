Cambridge Consultants has spun out twenty-seven startups and four unicorns - a track record better than any UK venture capitalist or university.[^1] If CC were in the Silicon Valley, we would all know how they achieved this, I want to tell this story better and bring more information about their heyday to the startup community. David Connell's piece "[Exploding the Myths of UK Innovation Policy](http://davidconnell.org/research-reports-and-company-case-studies/)" is a great reference text for this.

[^1]: h/t to Eric Gilliam for pitching the term "a new model for DeepTech VC" in his work on the MIT Technology Plan - the US version of this story.
