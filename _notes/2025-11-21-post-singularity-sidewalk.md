  The abundance era. Will the ASI allow us artisanal pavements?

When I think about post-singularity abundance, I think of this pavement in Sevres, Paris. For many years, we had to schlep along a tiny curb next to a busy main road, there was a clear need for a footpath. As you might expect, the Parisian approach was not to quickly put in a basic path but to spend five years creating the most decadent pavement ever seen. Fountains with Sevres porcelain tiles, statues, hand-placed cobblestones - this is what I imagine every footpath looks like with post-singularity abundance.

P.S. I am more interested in solving disease, hunger, and basic human needs than decadent pavements - but it's a fun musing.
