excerpt: "£100-1000 has a huge impact on students. Should I have a tiny grant pot to incentivise people to pickup projects?"

December 2016, after Church I sit excitedly in the Grindstone pub, pitching my friends on giving out mince pies to our whole engineering cohort. Without request Mark Russel whipped out £20 to pay for the idea. This small amount of money had a huge impact on me - Mark encouraged high-agency, funded me, and counterfactually made the mince pie handing out happen.

£100-1000 has a huge impact on students. I for one would have dedicated all my free time to something if given that much money. Should I have a tiny grant pot to incentivise people to pickup projects?
