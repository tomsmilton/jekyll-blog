*The Woodlawn Wanderer 9 - a fully analogue, completely automated, mammalian cell culture system.*

In 1973 NASA launched Skylab 3 - a 59-day, manned, orbital mission. Aboard this spacestation was an automated cell culture system - the "Woodlawn Wanderer 9". Over the next 50 years no-one has cracked automated mammalian cell culture. What can we learn from their system?
