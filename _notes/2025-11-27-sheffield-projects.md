I've always got a rogue pitch for something that I'd like to be built in Sheffield:

**SYMCA should buy Stanage Lodge and turn it into an "investor retreat venue".** They should then wine and dine US VCs pitching Sheffield as the outdoor city with an engineering heritage.

**Crookes needs a hub.** There is no natural meeting point for group rides or runs. The Crookes sports club could easily be turned into a cafe / community space that becomes the outdoor sports hub of Crookes.

**Business canteen.** I love the Moor Market - I want cheap, adequate food served in a large hall (school dinners?). The goal of this is to bring together Sheffield's business community each lunchtime - forcing knowledge spillover.
